# Conclusion:
BMW maintained a large total sales base over 2010â€“2024, but growth has been almost flat (0.28% CAGR). Asia and Europe are the strongest regions, with the 7 Series, X1, and 3 Series driving sales. 70% of the sales falls as a low sales classification which indicates a less than 7,000 sales volume, and 30% as high classification which attained higher sales volume from the mentioned number. Base on the output, the goal of the project has been obtained.
